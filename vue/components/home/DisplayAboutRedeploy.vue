    <p>ARI was established by the
      <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=096-0761">Crime Reduction Act</a> (Public Act 96-0761) to provide financial incentives to local jurisdictions for programs that
      allow diversion of non-violent offenders from state prisons by providing community-based services. Grants are provided
      to counties, groups of counties, and judicial circuits to increase programming in their areas, in exchange for reducing
      the number of people they send to the Illinois Department of Corrections.</p>

    <p>The Crime Reduction Act is based on the premise that crime can be reduced and the costs of the criminal justice system
      can be controlled by understanding and addressing the reasons why people commit crimes. It is also based on the premise
      that local jurisdictions (judicial circuits or counties) know best what resources are necessary to reduce crime. Rigorous
      evaluation processes with standardized performance measurements are required to confirm the effectiveness of services
      in reducing crime. </p>

    <p>ARI is modeled after the successful juvenile Redeploy Illinois program operating since 2005. ARI is an example of the
      “performance incentive funding” best practice, intended to align fiscal and operational responsibility for non-violent
      offenders at the local level to produce better public safety at a lower cost. ARI draws on concepts of justice reinvestment,
      such as using data to implement strategies that drive down corrections costs and free up dollars for investment in
      community-based programs addressing recidivism.</p>

    <p>The goals of ARI are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce crime and recidivism in a way that is cost effective for taxpayers.</li>
      <li>Provide financial incentives to counties or judicial circuits to create effective local-level evidence-based services.</li>
      <li>Encourage the successful local supervision of eligible offenders and their reintegration into the locality.</li>
      <li>Perform rigorous data collection and analysis to assess the outcomes of the programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Results expected with Adult Redeploy Illinois include reduced prison overcrowding; lowered cost to taxpayers; an end
      to the expensive vicious cycle of crime and incarceration. </p>

    <p>As of June 2017, Adult Redeploy Illinois has
      <strong>20 local sites</strong> operating
      <strong>39 diversion programs</strong> serving
      <strong>39 counties</strong>. Additionally, ARI funds planning in areas covering
      <strong>10 additional counties</strong>.</p>
